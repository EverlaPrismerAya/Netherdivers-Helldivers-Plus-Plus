LuaJIT (MIT) compiles the runtime Lua sources and runs isolated checks. Supply a Windows x64 non-GC64 build matching the supported game's bytecode mode.

The loader embeds the supported game's original Wwise callbacks in its generated archive. Developers extract that resource and the test boot resource from their own installation. extracted game resources and compiled releases are excluded from source control.

Optional integration tests use locally supplied HDArsenal, HD2MM, HUD+ and HUD Ballistic Trajectory Overlay fixtures. Those applications and mod resources are not bundled with this source project. Overlay compatibility calls the separately installed module. its implementation and configuration are not included in the loader ZIP.
